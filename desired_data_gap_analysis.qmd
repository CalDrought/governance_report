## Introduction

The Desired Gap Analysis outlines the recommended information, datasets, and analytical capabilities necessary to answer pressing water management questions at the state and local levels. This section complements the Current Gap Analysis by focusing not on what is missing, but on what should be available or improved in order to support more accurate forecasting, planning, and policy decisions. This includes identifying external datasets that could be integrated, recommending the adoption of new data collection practices (e.g., flow measurements, conservation tracking), and strengthening modeling methodologies. Each question below identifies a decision-making need and is paired with a proposed solution that would enable state and local water managers to answer that question reliably using data and analytics.

## State Level Questions

### Is there a spatial and/or temporal pattern in water shortages?

**Solution 1** To address spatial and temporal patterns in water shortages, it is necessary to integrate geographic information system (GIS) data with historical and forecasted shortage levels. \
For example, incorporating weather datasets (e.g., precipitation, temperature anomalies, snowpack levels) and hydrologic flow data from stream gauges will improve understanding of spatial trends and groundwater availability spatial datasets can be useful to understand temporal patterns. Datasets should include consistent monthly records, this analysis also requires complete dataset across water districts.

Potential analysis include:\
\
Water Availability Data: This includes data on precipitation, runoff, river flows, groundwater levels, and other relevant hydrological factors. \
\
Water Demand Data: This includes population density, agricultural land use, industrial water use, and other indicators of water consumption. \
\
Water Availability Calculations: Use hydrological models or simplified calculations to estimate water availability in different areas. This might involve calculating the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration, or using more complex models to account for runoff, recharge, and other factors.

## Local Level Questions

### Is my supply meeting my demand? For what time frame, the upcoming year?

**Solution** Water districts must ensure they are tracking monthly water production (supply) and usage data (demand) and properly submitting the reports. A standard method of determining shortage should be included in the forms provided so water resource managers can provide their numbers. \
Further analysis can be performed to check if there is alignment with forecasted population growth, weather patterns and planned conservation actions.

For forecasting over the upcoming year, agencies need to integrate short-term weather projections, current reservoir or groundwater levels, and planned conservation targets into their forecasts. Incorporating near-term hydrologic models and leveraging their own complete datasets can improve local predictive capacity.

## State and Local Level Questions

**Please describe how you would calculate supply and demand changes over time across California (local, regional, state-wide)? \*\*should we include this one?**

### How is my change in supply/demand relative to those around me?

**Solution 3**

### Is the rate of supply and/or demand increasing or decreasing?

**Solution** To determine these rates, a complete time-series datasets are completed to understand the full picture. The gap of limited datasts should be closed through regulatory requirements for full historical backfilling and future monthly submissions.

### How much water does agriculture/big industrial sites consume in the area? How is this changing the demand pattern?

**Solution** This analysis can be performed using historical water metered data. It is suggested to ask water districts to identify their large metered customers, and extract these historical datasets from utilities or customers. Alternatively, a program can be implemented to temporarly install a sensor to a nearby water network asset (e.g a hydrant) that can capture the weekly patterns of consumption.

### How do you assess if there is a projected risk of shortages in the future?

**Solution** Forecasting shortage risks requires the integration of multi-year climate forecasts, current storage data, and forecasted demand models. \
Consider scenario-based modeling should include best, median, and worst-case outcomes and incorporate known variables like planned developments or drought policy changes. Using machine learning models trained on historical shortages could also support probabilistic forecasting.

### How do you identify trends (increasing/decreasing) in shortages?

**Solution** To identify trends, conduct time-series analyses on historical shortage data. Ensure monthly resolution and geographic tagging. Consider computing indicators like frequency, duration, and severity of shortages. Data visualization tools such as heatmaps and cumulative shortage curves can support trend communication. This also requires standardization across water districts.

### Do you evaluate if the projections have been accurate, if so, please explain what methods are used to assess the accuracy of the projections?

**Solution** A solution would involve establishing a forecast verification framework where past forecasted values are regularly compared against actual outcomes using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). \
\
Agencies should also document the assumptions and inputs behind their forecasts.

### Are my neighbors impacted by drought in the same way I am?

**Solution** To compare drought impacts across neighboring areas, a statewide drought impact should be included in the dashboard that maps conditions across water districts and overlays climate data would help reveal regional differences. This analysis requires historical records of drought levels, which should be calculated using the same procedures for a fair comparison.

### It is raining â€“ why is my local water supplier concerned about drought?

**Solution** Addressing this question requires clear communication about the difference between short-term weather events and long-term water supply , perhaps an integration of data: cumulative data on storage, runoff, and long-term precipitation trends, and a public-facing explanation of how supply planning works on seasonal and annual scales, not just immediate weather.

### How much water will my region need to conserve if we enter a drought?

**Solution** This question can only be answered if suppliers develop drought response plans that quantify conservation goals under different drought scenarios. This includes setting regional targets based on projected supply shortfalls, expected demand, and available storage. To standardize this, statewide guidance should require suppliers to submit scenario-based conservation estimates that can be aggregated regionally and communicated proactively.

### Where are suppliers at risk of shortage? What is their history of shortage?

**Solution** To assess current and historical risk of shortage, some datasets of the records of shortage events, can be analyzed, including: duration, severity, response actions. \
Additionally, this data should be then linked to the supply sources, storage capacity, and demand patterns datasets.
