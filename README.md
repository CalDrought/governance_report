# Gap Analysis of Datasets and Usability of Urban Drought Water Data
#### This repository was created for the Data for Drought Resilience capstone project 

**Authors include:** Tom Gibbens-Matsuyama, Emma Bea Mitchell, Karol Paya, Takeen Shamloo

**Advisor:** Dr. Naomi Tague

**Client:** California Water Data Consortium

## Description:

This gap analysis was created to analyze the gaps in usability of the urban drought water data currently located on the [CNRA website](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/urban-water-data-drought). Water managers and other stakeholders may want access to reported data from water agencies around California. The open source portal on the CNRA website gives them an opportunity to access previously unaccessible data. In order to make the portal and the data even more usable for stakeholders, and to be upfront and honest about limitations in the data, this gap analysis provides a detailed walkthrough of issues in and outside of the data, providing coding solutions and checks when necessary. This is intended for internal use by the California Water Data Consortium and others in charge of portal maintenance, as well as stakeholders who are interested in a more detailed look at data limitations.
